            Starcraft 2 is a true gaming classic, successor to the game which arguably launched Esports and to this day a true landmark of competetive multiplayer games <br>
            While the game has a high skill ceiling which allows for significant mastery and all manner of creative plays and approaches to the game the truth is that <br>
            the game is approachable to players of all skill levels, with a wide variety of Arcade modes, Campaign, Coop and skill based matchmaking.
